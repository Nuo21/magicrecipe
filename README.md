# <Magic Recipe - Meals from Ingredients>

## Description

Have you ever had no clue as to what you wanted to make to eat? Whether it be breakfast, lunch, or dinner, this web app has your back! Instead of searching for a recipe and learning to make it, our app allows you to find recipes based on the INGREDIENTS you have. It is similar to your typical recipe finder, but this way, users will be able to see which ingredients they have first, and then enter it into the search box and be shown a variety of meals that they can make with that ingredient. What's even better is that one the user selects a recipe that want to recreate, a modal box will be displayed with some general information and steps on how to make it AND a link to a YouTube video that they can follow along. Another great thing about this web app is that on page load, the user is greeted with a randomized inspiring quote!
